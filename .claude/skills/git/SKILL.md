## Context Files

- **branch-strategies.md**: Branch naming and workflow patterns

## Commands

```bash
# Check branch status
git branch --show-current
git status

# Validate branch naming
# Branch format: {type}/{descriptive-slug}
# Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, chore, hotfix

# Create conventional commit
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
{type}({scope}): {description}

{body}

{footer}
EOF
)"
```

| docs/         | docs:       | No release     |
| refactor/     | refactor:   | No release     |
| perf/         | perf:       | Patch (0.0.X)  |
